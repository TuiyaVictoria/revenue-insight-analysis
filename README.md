# Superstore Sales & Profitability Analysis
Analyzing retail performance through SQL to drive business growth and margin optimization.
## Project Overview
This project explores a multi-year retail dataset to identify high-performing products, profitable regions, and the impact of pricing strategies. Using SQL, I transformed raw transactional data into business intelligence to help stakeholders understand where to invest and where to cut costs.
## Dataset Used
[Superstore Sales Dataset](https://github.com/TuiyaVictoria/revenue-insight-analysis/blob/main/SampleSuperstore.csv)

### Key Business Questions
1. Profitability: Which products are "Loss Leaders" (high sales but negative profit)?
2. Operations: How does shipping mode and regionality affect the bottom line?
3. Strategy: At what percentage does a discount stop driving growth and start destroying profit?
