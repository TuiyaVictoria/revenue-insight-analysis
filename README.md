# Superstore Sales & Profitability Analysis
Analyzing retail performance through SQL to drive business growth and margin optimization.
## Project Overview
This project explores a multi-year retail dataset to identify high-performing products, profitable regions, and the impact of pricing strategies. Using SQL, I transformed raw transactional data into business intelligence to help stakeholders understand where to invest and where to cut costs.
## Dataset Used
[Superstore Sales Dataset](https://github.com/TuiyaVictoria/revenue-insight-analysis/blob/main/SampleSuperstore.csv)

### Key Business Questions
1. Profitability: Which products are "Loss Leaders" (high sales but negative profit)?
2. Operations: How does shipping mode and regionality affect the bottom line?
3. Strategy: At what percentage does a discount stop driving growth and start destroying profit?
### Analysis Deep Dive
1.High-Level Performance
The first step was establishing the total health of the business by calculating total revenue and total profit.
2.Category Insights
I analyzed sales by category to see which business units lead the market.
3.The Discount Impact (Crucial Finding)
By grouping data by discount levels, I identified the threshold where discounts become detrimental to the business.
### Visualizations

### Actionable Insights
1.Optimize Discounts: Data shows that discounts exceeding 20% drastically reduce the average profit per transaction.
2.Focus on Technology: While the volume is lower than Office Supplies, the profit margin in Technology is significantly higher.
3.Regional Strategy: The West Region outperforms others; a "Deep Dive" into their shipping methods is recommended to replicate success elsewhere.
